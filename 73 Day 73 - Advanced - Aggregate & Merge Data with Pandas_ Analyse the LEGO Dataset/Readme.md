### 612 Use HTML Markdown to Make Your Notebook Look Pretty

The cells inside the notebook can either be code cells for your Python code or Text (Markdown) cells. 
The starter notebook includes a few of these Text cells with section headings and challenge text. 
However, we can style these cells even more by using HTML (see Days 43 and 44).

**Insert a Markdown Cell**

Add a new Text cell below the Introduction.

Display an image in a Text cell, use an HTML <img> tag with the URL of the image.

**Section Headings**

You can add section headings using tags like <h1> or <h2>. 
However, the Notebook also has its own shorthand for common HTML tags. 
For example, you can use the # symbol as a shortcut.

**Challenge**

1. Find out how many different colour LEGO bricks are actually in production!
2. Figure out how many of the LEGO colours are transparent compared to how many colours are opaque.
