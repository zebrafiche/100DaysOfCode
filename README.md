# 100DaysOfCode

In this repository, I am keeping all my work for the Udemy course "100 Days of Code" by Angela Yu.
Each folder represents a project, just like the way it is structured in the course itself.
Some of the earlier days, i.e. Days 1 through 30 something, did not require setting up an environment, hence those projects are represented as individual files, instead of folders.
