# 097 Day 10 Goals_ what we will make by the end of the day

# By the end of the day, we will build a calculator




# 098 Functions with Outputs

# We already know a few things about functions
# Now there is another type of function, that has an output

    result = 3*2

# So now when we call the function we get an output "result"
# This can be stored in a variable

    # We are going to make the names titlecase
    firstname = f_name.title() 
    lastname = l_name.title()
    return f"{firstname} {lastname}"
    # Now instead of printing we could also return the output
formatstring = format_name('abdullah', 'rafi')
print(formatstring)
# Abdullah Rafi

# We can visualize this better with Thonny

# Diff between "print" and "return" - 
# for example the len() function does not print the length, it stores it of sorts
# the return keyword is the most imp thing for functions that has an output




# 099 Multiple return values

    print('this got printed')

print(format_name('abdullah', 'rafi'))
# Abdullah Rafi
# The next line never gets printed

# The return keyword effectively ends the function, wherever it is

# For example, we want to bypass the function if the user types nothing in parameters, so no firstname or lastname
def format_name(f_name, l_name):
    # We are going to make the names titlecase
    if f_name == "" or l_name == "":

# None

# 100 [Interactive Coding Exercise] Days in Month

# In the starting code, you'll find the solution from the Leap Year challenge. 
# First, convert this function `is_leap()` so that instead of printing "Leap year." or "Not leap year." 
# it should **return** `True` if it is a leap year and **return** `False` if it is not a leap year.

# You are then going to create a function called `days_in_month()` which will take a **year** and a **month** as inputs, e.g.
# days_in_month(year=2022, month=2)
# ```

# And it will use this information to work out the **number of days in the month**, 
# then **return** that as the **output**, **e.g.:**

# ```
# 28
# ```

# The List month_days contains the number of days in a month from January to December for a non-leap year. 
# A leap year has 29 days in February.

# # Hint

# 1. Look at the function call at the bottom of the code to see the positional arguments.  
# The order is very important.

# 2. Feel free to choose your own parameter names.

# 3. Remember that `month_days` is a List and Lists in Python start at position 0. 
# So the number of days in January is `month_days[0]`

# 4. Be careful with indentation.

# Question - Why return at all, why not just do a print statement? It is basically doing the same thing




# 101 Docstrings

# Docstrings are basically a way for us to create little bits of documentation as we're coding along
# in our functions or in our other blocks of code.

# For example the len() function, as soon as you open up the parenthesis you see a little piece of documentation
# telling you what it does

# How to do the same for the functions we write? Docstrings

 
def format_name(f_name, l_name):
   """Take a first and last name and 
   format it in titlecase"""
# The docstring comes right after you define a function, and comes with three quotation marks

#  Now you can see that as you type format_name the description pops up, one that you wrote just now
