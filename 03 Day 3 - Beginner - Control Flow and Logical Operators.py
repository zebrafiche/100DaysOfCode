# 029 [Interactive Coding Exercise] Odd or Even_ Introducing the Modulo

# Write a program that works out whether if a given number is an odd or even number. 
# Even numbers can be divided by 2 with no remainder.
# e.g. 86 is **even** because 86 รท 2 = 43
# 43 does not have any decimal places. Therefore the division is clean.
# e.g. 59 is **odd** because 59 รท 2 = 29.5
# 29.5 is not a whole number, it has decimal places. Therefore there is a remainder of 0.5, so the division is not clean.
# The **modulo** is written as a percentage sign (%) in Python. It gives you the remainder after a division.

num = float(input())
if num%2 == 0:
    print('Even')
else:
    print('Odd')

# 036 [Interactive Coding Exercise] Love Calculator

# To work out the love score between two people:

# Then check for the number of times the letters in the word LOVE occurs. Then combine these numbers to make a 2 digit number. 

# For Love Scores **less than 10** or **greater than 90**, the message should be:
# `"Your score is **x**, you go together like coke and mentos."` 

# For Love Scores **between 40** and **50**, the message should be:
