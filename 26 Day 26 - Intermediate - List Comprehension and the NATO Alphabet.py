# 232 Day 26 Goals_ what you will make by the end of the day

# Today we are going to learn about list and dictionary comprehensions
# This is something that is rally unique to the python

# Cuts down a lot of code writing

# By the end of the day we will have built a project to use the NATO phonetic alphabet
# So we can use spell out various things on the telephone

# We will enter a word, and the program will return a list of words, each starting with each letter of the word


# 233 How to Create Lists using List Comprehension

# List comprehension is really unique to the python language
# It significantly cuts down on the amount of typing

# What exactly is list comprehension?
# It is a case where you create a new list from a previous list

# For example -
# What if I have a list -
sample_list = [1, 2, 3]
# and I wanted to create a new list where each number would be incremented by 1
# I would use the for loops
new_list = []
for i in sample_list:
    i = i + 1
    new_list.append(i)
print(new_list)
# [2, 3, 4]

# Now, under the list comprehension principle it would look something like this-
# new_list = [new_item for item in list]
# OR, new_list = [do_this for item in list]

# So according to the formula above, replace new_item/do_this, item and list -
new_list = [i + 1 for i in sample_list]
# Let's do i+10 for better comprehension
new_list = [i + 10 for i in sample_list]
print(new_list)

# [11, 12, 13]

name = 'Angela'
new_list = [l for l in name]
print(new_list)
# ['A', 'n', 'g', 'e', 'l', 'a']

# In python, lists, ranges, strings and tuples are called sequences
# Which means they have a specific order
# When you preform a list comprehension, it performs an operation to the sequence under that order
# So we can do list comprehension with them as well
new_list = [i*2 for i in range(1, 5)]
print(new_list)
# [2, 4, 6, 8]

# Conditional List Comprehension
# same as list comprehension, but we add a condition
# new_list = [new_item/do_this for item in list if test]

names = ["Alex", "Beth", "Caroline", "Dave", "Elanor", "Freddie"]
# In PyCharm, if you want to change the spelling of "Elanor", you can do so directly from the console]
# Execute it, the list will be available in the console
# Expand names > Elanor > (right click) set value > Eleanor
print(names)
# ['Alex', 'Beth', 'Caroline', 'Dave', 'Eleanor', 'Freddie']

# Create a new list of names made up of the short names, i.e. names made up of four letters or less

new_names = [i for i in names if len(i) <= 4]
print(new_names)
# ['Alex', 'Beth', 'Dave']

# Challenge - create a new list from names, but each name should be uppercase

new_names = [i.upper() for i in names]
print(new_names)
# ['ALEX', 'BETH', 'CAROLINE', 'DAVE', 'ELEANOR', 'FREDDIE']
new_names = [i.upper() for i in names if len(i) <= 4]
print(new_names)
# ['ALEX', 'BETH', 'DAVE']


# 234 [Interactive Coding Exercise] Squaring Numbers

# You are going to write a List Comprehension to create a new list called `squared_numbers`.
# This new list should contain every number in the list `numbers` but each number should be squared.

numbers = [1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55]
# ðŸš¨ Do Not Change the code above ðŸ‘†

# Write your 1 line code ðŸ‘‡ below:

squared_numbers = [n**2 for n in numbers]

# Write your code ðŸ‘† above:

print(squared_numbers)
# [1, 1, 4, 9, 25, 64, 169, 441, 1156, 3025]


# 235 [Interactive Coding Exercise] Filtering Even Numbers

# You are going to write a List Comprehension to create a new list called `result`.
# This new list should only contain the even numbers from the list `numbers`.

numbers = [1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55]
# ðŸš¨ Do Not Change the code above

# Write your 1 line code ðŸ‘‡ below:

result = [n for n in numbers if n % 2 == 0]

# Write your code ðŸ‘† above:

print(result)
# [2, 8, 34]


# 236 [Interactive Coding Exercise] Data Overlap

# Take a look inside **file1.txt** and **file2.txt**. They each contain a bunch of numbers, each number on a new line.
# You are going to create a list called result which contains the numbers that are common in both files.

file1 = []
with open('file1.txt') as file:
    for i in file.readlines():
        file1.append(int(i))
print(file1)
# [3, 6, 5, 8, 33, 12, 7, 4, 72, 2, 42, 13]
file2 = []
with open('file2.txt') as file:
    for i in file.readlines():
        file2.append(int(i))
print(file2)
# [3, 6, 13, 5, 7, 89, 12, 3, 33, 34, 1, 344, 42]

result = [n for n in file2 if n in file1]

# Write your code above ðŸ‘†

print(result)
# [3, 6, 13, 5, 7, 12, 3, 33, 42]
# if we do [n for n in file1 if n in file2], then -
# [3, 6, 5, 33, 12, 7, 42, 13]


# 237 Apply List Comprehension to the U.S. States Game

# In our US states game, before a part of the code was like this -

            undiscovered_states.append(i)
    # undiscovered_states = {
    #     'states_not_guessed': undiscovered_states
    # }
    # no need to create the dict, just feed the list to pandas, that will also do
    us_df = pandas.DataFrame(undiscovered_states)
    us_df.to_csv('undiscovered_states.csv')
    break

# Change it using the List Comprehension method -

if formatted_answer == 'Exit':
    undiscovered_states = [i for i in states_list if i not in correct_answers_list]
    # for i in states_list:

# 238 How to use Dictionary Comprehension
